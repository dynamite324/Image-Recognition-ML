# Image-Recognition-ML
This project guided me through building an image recognition model in Python
 using deep learning. Over five days, I learned fundamental concepts and practical
 skills in image classification, culminating in a deployable, portfolio-ready toolkit
 showcasing their expertise in computer vision.


 WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?
 
 
 The bootcamp is designed to transform beginners into skilled AI practitioners by
 teaching them how to preprocess images, train convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
 and build an image recognition system using Python and popular libraries like
 TensorFlow/Keras. I was able to develop hands-on experience with essential machine
 learning workflows, deepen their understanding of model evaluation, and create
 professional portfolio assetsâ€”preparing them for high-paying roles in data science and
 computer vision.
 Learning Outcomes & Skills Developed:
 Image preprocessing and augmentation
 Deep learning fundamentals and CNN architecture
 Model training, evaluation, and optimization
 Visualization of results and metrics
 Collaboration and documentation best practices
 Showcasing ML projects for recruiters
 

 STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION:

  Preprocess and Explore Your Dataset
 Download a free image dataset (e.g., MNIST, Cats vs. Dogs, CIFAR-10 from Kaggle);
 normalize, resize, and visualize sample images using Python and OpenCV.
 
 Build & Train Your First CNN Model
 
 Implement a basic convolutional neural network using TensorFlow/Keras in Google
 Colab, train it on your dataset, and monitor accuracy/loss metrics.
 
 Enhance with Data Augmentation & Model Evaluation
 
 Apply image augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping) and evaluate your model
 using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. Visualize
 your results using Matplotlib.

Optimize with Transfer Learning
 Fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., MobileNetV2 or similar) on your dataset,
 compare its performance to your custom CNN, and analyze improvements
